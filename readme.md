Automatopia
=============

This repository contains build and test automation for JavaScript projects. It's intended as a starting point for your own JavaScript projects. It includes:

* Automated continuous integration (using Git)
* Automated deployment (to Heroku)
* Automated build (using Jake) with:
	* Linting (using JSHint)
	* Node.js tests (using NodeUnit)
	* Cross-browser tests (using Karma, Mocha, and expect.js)
* Example code (in the `src` directory):
	* Server-side integration test
	* Development smoke test
	* Release smoke test
	* Client-side DOM test

This code was developed for the "Lessons Learned 8: Automatopia" episode of James Shore's *Let's Code: Test-Driven JavaScript* screencast. For details, the video, and a transcript, see [letscodejavascript.com](http://www.letscodejavascript.com).


To Use
------
To use this repository as a starting point for a personal project, follow the steps under "Building and Testing," below. For a team of developers using the continuous integration script, follow the steps under "Continuous Integration." For a team of developers using the Heroku deployment script, follow the steps under "Deploying to Heroku."

Latest major changes:
* 24 Sept 2013: Upgraded to Karma 0.10 (also updated all other npm dependencies to latest versions)


Building and Testing
--------------------

Before building for the first time:

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).
2. Download and unzip [the source code](https://github.com/jamesshore/automatopia/archive/master.zip) into a convenient directory.
3. All commands must run from the root of the source tree: `cd <directory>`.
4. To cause the build to fail unless certain browsers are tested, edit `REQUIRED_BROWSERS` at the top of `Jakefile.js`. Otherwise, comment those lines out.

To build (and test):

1. Run `./jake.sh karma` (Unix/Mac) or `jake karma` (Windows) to start the Karma server.
2. Start the browsers you want to test and point each one at `http://localhost:8080`.
3. Run `./jake.sh` (Unix/Mac) or `jake` (Windows) every time you want to build and test.


Continuous Integration
----------------------

To set up continuous integration for a team of developers:

1. Choose a machine to be the integration machine.
2. Follow the steps for "Building and Testing" on the integration machine.
3. Run `git init`, `git add .`, and `git commit -a -m "Initial Commit"` to initialize the git repository.
4. Run `git checkout -b integration` to create and checkout the integration branch.

To set up each development workstation:

1. Choose an easy-to-type name for the development workstation, such as `dev1`. Put a label on the machine with this name so you don't forget it--you'll use it when you integrate.
2. *On the integration machine*, run `git branch <name>` to create a branch for the development workstation.
3. Clone the integration machine's repository to the development workstation. (The steps here depend on your network configuration. Talk to your local Git expert.)
4. *On the development workstation,* run `git checkout <name>` to switch to the development branch.
5. Now you can build and test as described above.

To integrate:

1. On the development workstation, get to a clean build and commit your code.
2. Run `./ci.sh pull` (Unix/Mac) or `ci pull` (Windows) to integrate the latest changes from the integration machine.
3. Run the build to make sure the integration didn't break anything.
4. Run `./ci.sh push[<name>]` (Unix/Mac) or `ci push[<name>]` (Windows) to push your changes to your workstation's branch on the integration machine.
5. *On the integration machine,* run `./ci.sh promote[<name>]` (Unix/Mac) or `ci promote[<name>]` (Windows) to double-check your build and merge it into the known-good integration branch.
6. Start over on your development machine if anything breaks or if someone else integrates before you're done.


Deploying to Heroku
-------------------

Before deploying for the first time:

1. Follow the steps for "Continuous Integration" first.
3. Sign up for a [Heroku account](https://api.heroku.com/signup).
2. *On the integration machine,* install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).
4. Create a Heroku application: `heroku create <app_name>`.
5. *On a development machine,* change `PRODUCTION_URL` at the top of `deploy.jakefile` to `http://<app_name>.herokuapp.com`.
6. Update `package.json` to match your installed versions of Node and npm. (Use `node --version` and `npm --version` to get the version numbers.)
7. Integrate as described above.

To deploy:

1. *On the integration machine,* run `./deploy.sh latest` (Unix/Mac) or `deploy latest` (Windows) to deploy the integration branch to Heroku. The script will tag your git repository with `deploy-<timestamp>` if the deploy succeeds and passes the smoke tests.

In case of a bad deployment:

1. *On the integration machine,* run `./deploy.sh rollback` (Unix/Mac) or `deploy rollback` (Windows) to do a band-aid rollback to the previous Heroku deployment. This rollback won't "stick", so you'll need to deploy new code soon.
2. If you aren't able to deploy new code right away, choose a previous, good commit to deploy. `gitk` and the `deploy-<timestamp>` tags may be helpful here.
3. Check out the commit: `git checkout <commit_id>`
4. Run `./deploy.sh head` (Unix/Mac) or `deploy head` (Windows) to deploy the commit to Heroku. As above, the script will tag the git repository with `deploy-<timestamp>` if the deploy succeeds and passes the smoke tests.
